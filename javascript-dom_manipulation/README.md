## Introduction

In this folder, you will find examples and exercises that demonstrate how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. The DOM is a programming interface for web documents, allowing you to interact with and modify the structure, style, and content of HTML documents.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Familiarize yourself with the concept of the DOM and how it represents the structure of an HTML document.

## Examples

The `examples` folder contains various code examples that demonstrate different aspects of DOM manipulation. Each example is accompanied by a README file explaining the purpose and usage of the code.

## Exercises

The `exercises` folder contains hands-on exercises that will help you practice and reinforce your understanding of DOM manipulation. Each exercise is provided with a starter code and a set of instructions to follow.

## Resources
